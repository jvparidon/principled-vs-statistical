# Principled versus statistical generics
This repository contains the stimuli, data, and analysis for a project examining the differences between generics that have a principled 
relationship between a concept and its property (e.g. circles are round) and generics that have a statistical relationship (e.g. cars have 
radios), a relationship that is generally true but not necessarily true of each instance.

The repository is organized as follows:
* `rating_study_generate_trials.ipynb`: notebook for generating trial lists used in the rating study
* `rating_study_data_cleaning.ipynb`: notebook for cleaning and aggregating raw rating data
* `rating_study_data_analysis.ipynb`: notebooks with data analysis for rating data, including cloze probabilities and cosine distances from 
ALBERT (a large transformer model) and mixed-effects models analyzing relationships between various ratings and types of generics
* `data/`: data files
* `figures/`: figures generated by `rating_study_data_analysis.ipynb`
* `trials/`: trials generated by `rating_study_generate_trials.ipynb`
* `papers/`: PDF copies of the Prasada et al. papers that some of the stimuli were taken from
